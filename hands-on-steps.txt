Hands-on steps

1. Create a stack
Source openrc of your devstack, if you use the OpenStack provided by us, an openrc is available there, source it as follow :

    cd /home/demo/hands-on/heat/
    . openrc.demo ; 
	
Create stack:   
    heat stack-create -e env.yaml -f test-lb.yaml  <stack-name>
(Notes: If you use the OpenStack env provided by us, please use your group number as the stack name such as group1 so that we can track the progress of your stack. )

2. Check stack status

Check resource-list of stack :  
    heat resource-list <stack-name>
Check status of VM in the stack: 
    nova list | grep <stack-name>
    nova console-log <cluster-member-vm>

3. Logon the vm
Get private key : /home/demo/hands-on/heat/heat-key-print <stack-name> or heat output 
------------------heat-key-print-----------------------------------------------------------
#!/bin/bash
#
# heat-key-print
#
# print the ssh private key of the stack
#
function usage
{
    echo "heat-key-print <stack>" 1>&2
    exit 1
}
[ $1 ] || usage
stack=$1
keypair=` heat resource-list $stack 2>/dev/null| awk '{ print $2, $4 }' | grep ^keypair | awk '{print $2}'`
echo -n -e `heat output-show $keypair key 2>/dev/null| sed 's/"//g'`
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Save the private key into a temprory file such as /tmp/group1.key
Change its permission to 600 such as "chmod 600 /tmp/group1.key"
Logon the vm: 
   ssh -i /tmp/group1.key fedora@<vm-ip>

You can check stack progress by "heat resource-list <stack-name> " or "nova console <server>"

4.  Get cluster information when stack is in CREATE_COMPLETE 

Get floatingip of vip:  heat output-show <stack-name>  vip_floatingip
Check group size of the stack :  heat outputshow <stack-name> asg_size
Check member list of the cluster :  heat outputshow <stack-name> member_list

5. Test webapp by vip when stack is in CREATE_COMPLETE 

Get floatingip of the vip : 
    heat output-show <stack-name> vip_floatingip
Test floatingip of the vip :  
    curl <floatingip of vip> , it will output server's hostname and current time
Test vip: logon the vm, and run "curl <vip>"

6. Add a new member into cluster  <optional>                 

Get scale up url: 
   heat output-show <stack-name> scale_up_url
Scale up: 
   curl -XPOST -i  <scale_up_url>
Test vip :  curl <vip> for several times, the request will be redirected to member1 and member2
