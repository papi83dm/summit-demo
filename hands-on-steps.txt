Hands-on steps

1. Create a stack

cd /home/demo/hands-on/ heat/
. openrc.demo ; 
heat stack-create –e env.yaml –f test-lb.yaml  <stack-name>
please use your group number as the stack name such as group1 so that we can track the progress of your stack. 

2. Check stack 

check resource-list of stack :  heat resource-list <stack-name>
check status of VM in the stack: 
    nova list | grep <stack-name>
    nova console-log <cluster-member-vm>

3. Logon the vm
Get private key : /home/demo/hands-on/heat/heat-key-print <stack-name>
Save the private key into a temprory file such as /tmp/group1.key
Change its permission to 600 by “chmod 600 /tmp/group1.key”
Logon the vm: ssh –i /tmp/group1.key fedora@<vm-ip>

You can check stack progress by “heat resource-list <stack>” or nova console <server>

4.  Get cluster information when stack is in CREATE_COMPLETE 

Get floatingip of vip:  heat output-show <stack-name>  vip_floatingip
Check group size of the stack :  heat outputshow <stack-name> asg_size
Check member list of the cluster :  heat outputshow <stack-name> member_list

5. Test webapp by vip when stack is in CREATE_COMPLETE 

Get floatingip of the vip : heat output-show <stack-name> vip_floatingip
Test floatingip of the vip :  curl <floatingip of vip> , it will output server’s hostname and current time
Test vip: logon the vm, and run “curl <vip>”

6. Add a new member into cluster  <optional>                 

Get scale up url: heat output-show <stack-name> scale_up_url
Scale up: curl –XPOST –i <scale_up_url>
Test vip :  curl <vip> for several times, the request will be redirected to member1 and member2
